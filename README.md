### Hi there 👋 I'm TheChicken14, and I like to code (duh) mainly in JS and React 😌 ✨ 

- 🔭 I'm currently working on an app called Remember Me for children that lost one of their parents. In the app they can create a profile and fill out lists with questions, kinda like a diary. Techstack: React Native, Expo, Node JS, Hapi and MongoDB
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
